To simplify the translation efforts for those who don't know about code, here
are the sentences that need to be translated to your language:

* Send
* #CETA and #TTIP = many dangers, little benefits, and no U-Turn possible. It is not worth it. #SayNo
* MEP
* We're supposed to send tweets to MEPs every Tuesday about #TTIP. This webpage is meant to ease that work.
* The text to be sent:

Submit your translation by going to
https://github.com/marado/TTIPTuesday/issues/new , typing your country name in
the "Title" field, and the translations for those sentences in the "Leave a
comment" field. 

Thank you!
