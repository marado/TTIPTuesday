## Making it better

### Adding other countries
If you want to add support to other countries, just copy pt.html into
yourcountry.html and change:
* translate all lines in the code which say "TRANSLATE"
* change the list of MEPs to the ones from your country, referring to your
  countries list on "CONFIGURE-MEPs-HERE"

Finally, don't forget to add your country in index.html !
